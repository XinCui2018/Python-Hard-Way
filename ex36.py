"""
Every if-statement must have an else
Never nest if-statements more than two deep and always
try to do them one deep. This means if you put an if in an if,
then you should be looking to move that second if into another function.
Your boolean tests should be simple. If they are complex, move their calculations
to variables earlier in your function and use a good name for the variable.
