assert For debugging
else   Used in conditional statements
if     To make a conditional statement
pass   A null statement, a statement that will do nothing.

return  To exit a function and return a value
def  To define a function
for   To create a for loop
lambda   To create a small anonymous function. A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression. The expression is evaluated and the result is returned.
